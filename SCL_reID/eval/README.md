pytorch_auto_eval_reference_query.ipynb
Loops through the models trained directory and for each of these models evaluates the model and trains a 1NN and a 3NN that saves the accuracy of each model inside of evaluation_reference_train_query_test.csv

TODO: add a feature to save the embeddings (e.g. in a csv file) and then evaluate
